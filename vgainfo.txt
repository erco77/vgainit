 I made the info in this document by referencing other sources, and in
 some cases pulling text verbatim.

 I converted diagrams to ascii art so it could be read on an 80x25 MS-DOS
 screen, and used this info during development.   -erco 3/28/2024

IMPORTANT NOTES:

     > Typical VGA uses /full frames/ (non-interlaced)

     > The CRT Controller's "Protect" bit can cause a lot of
       confusion if you don't first turn it off when trying
       to program the vert/horiz registers..! If it's on,
       all writing to those registers is IGNORED!

CRTC REGISTERS
==============

Horizontal Total: (Index=0x00)
---------------------------------
    Specify the number of character clocks per scan line.
    Along with dot rate, controls the horizontal refresh rate of the VGA
    by specifying amount of time one scan line takes.  This isn't the actual number
    of character clocks: due to timing factors of VGA hardware (compatibility)
    the actual horizontal total is 5 character clocks more than the value stored in this field.
    So subtract 5 from the desired horizontal total before programming it into this register.


End Horizontal Display: (Index 01h)
-----------------------------------
    Controls the point that the sequencer stops outputting pixel values
    from display memory and sequences pixel value specified by Overscan
    Palette Index for remainder of scan line.  The overscan begins the
    character clock after the value programmed here.  Register should be
    programmed with number of character clocks in the active display - 1.
    (Active display may be affected by the Display Enable Skew field,
    but it's usually disabled-erco)


End Horizontal Blanking Register (Index 03h)
--------------------------------------------
 ______________________________________________________________
|    7     |     6     |    5    |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
|__________|___________|_________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|   EVRA   | Display Enable Skew |   End Horizontal Blanking   |
|__________|_____________________|_____________________________|

    EVRA (Enable Vertical Retrace Access)
    -------------------------------------
    This was used by IBM EGA to provide access to light pen values.
    The VGA lacks light pen input, so this is normally forced to 1.
    (Always writing it as 1 may be good for compatibility.)

    Display Enable Skew
    -------------------
    Just set this to 0 always. Not worth describing.

    End Horizontal Blanking
    -----------------------
    This contains 5 bits (4-0) which specifies the end of the horizontal blanking period.
    Bit 5 is located after the period has begun as specified by the Start Horizontal Blanking field,
    the 6-bit value of this field is compared against the lower 6 bits of the character clock.
    When a match occurs, the horizontal blanking signal is disabled.  This provides from 1 to 64
    character clocks although some implementations may match in the character clock specified
    by the Start Horizontal Blanking field, in which case the range is 0 to 63.  Note if blanking
    extends past the end of the scan line, it will end on the first match of this field on the next scan line.


Start Horizontal Retrace Register (Index 04h)
---------------------------------------------
All 8 bits specify the character clock at which the VGA begins sending the horiz sync pulse, signaling monitor
to retrace back to the left side of the screen. End of this pulse is controlled by "End Horizontal Retrace".
Pulse may appear anywhere in the scan line, as well as set to a position beyond "Horizontal Total" field
which effectively disables the horizontal synchronization pulse.


End Horizontal Retrace Register (Index 05h)
-------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________
|    7     |     6     |    5    |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
|__________|___________|_________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|   EHB5   | Horiz. Retrace Skew |   End Horizontal Retrace    |
|__________|_____________________|_____________________________|

     EHB5 -- End Horizontal Blanking (bit 5)
     Contains bit 5 of "End Horizontal Blanking" field.

     Horizontal Retrace Skew
     Set to 0 normally. Exception set to 1 for 40 column mode.

     End Horizontal Retrace
     Specifies end of the horizontal retrace period, which begins at character clock specified
     in "Start Horizontal Retrace". Horizontal retrace signal is enabled until the lower 5 bits
     of character counter match the 5 bits of this field. This provides for a horizontal retrace
     period from 1 to 32 character clocks. Note some implementations may match immediately
     instead of 32 clocks away, making the effective range 0 to 31 character clocks.


Vertical Retrace End (Index 11h)
--------------------------------
 _________________________________________________________
|    7    |     6     |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
|_________|___________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
| Protect | Bandwidth |     |     |  Vert Retrace End     |
|_________|___________|_____|_____|_______________________|

    Protect
    -------
    When set to 1, CRTC register indexes 00h-07h ignore write access, with the exception
    of bit 4 of the Overflow Register, which holds bit 8 of the Line Compare field.
    (This field protects video timing registers from being changed by old programs written
    for earlier graphics chipsets that attempt to program these registers with values
    unsuitable for VGA timings)

    Bandwidth -- Memory Refresh Bandwidth
    -------------------------------------
    Most chipsets include registers that control memory, bus, or other timings not related to video output.
    Most ignore this value; however, IBM VGA adapters do utilize it and thus for compatibility with these
    chipsets this field should be programmed.  IBM VGA hardware uses this to control the number of DRAM refresh
    cycles per scan line. The three refresh cycles per scanline is appropriate for the IBM VGA horizontal freq
    of approximately 31.5 kHz.  For horizontal frequencies greater than this, this setting will work as DRAM
    will be refreshed more often.  However, refreshing not often enough for the DRAM can cause memory loss.
    Thus slower than 31.5 kHz the *five refresh cycle setting should be used*. At which particular point this
    should occur, would require better knowledge of the IBM VGA's schematics than I have available.
    According to IBM documentation, "Selecting five refresh cycles allows use of the VGA chip with 15.75 kHz
    displays." which isn't really enough to go by unless the mode you define has a 15.75 kHz horiz frequency.

    Vertical Retrace End
    --------------------
    Determines end of the vertical retrace pulse, and thus its length.  This field contains lower four bits
    of vertical scanline counter at the beginning of the scanline immediately after the last scanline where
    vertical retrace signal is asserted.


Offset Register (Index 13h)
---------------------------
    Specifies address difference between consecutive scan lines or two lines of characters.
    Beginning with second scan line, the starting scan line is increased by twice the value
    in this register, multiplied by the current memory address size (byte = 1, word = 2,
    double-word = 4) each line. For text modes the following equation is used:
        Offset = Width / ( MemoryAddressSize * 2 )
    ..and in graphics mode, the following equation is used:
        Offset = Width / ( PixelsPerAddress * MemoryAddressSize * 2 )
    ..where:
        > PixelsPerAddress  -- number of pixels stored in one display memory address
        > MemoryAddressSize -- current memory addressing size
        > Width             -- width in pixels of the screen
    This register can be modified to provide a virtual resolution, in which case
    Width is the width in pixels of the virtual screen.


VGA "Misc Output Register"
--------------------------
    Mask Value
    0xcc 0x44
    ---- ----
      1   0 -> 7: 0=positive vsync, 1=negative vsync pulse  \__ sync
      1   1 -> 6: 0=positive hsync, 1=negative hsync pulse  /   polarity
      0   0    5: 0=low page, 1=high page
      0   0    4: unused
      1   0 -> 3: \__ clock select: 00=25.175Mhz clock (320/640 pixel width modes)
      1   1 -> 2: /                 01=28.322MHz clock (360/720 pixel width modes)
      0   0    1: display memory access: 0=disable, 1=enable
      0   0    0: 0=CRT controller address is 0x03Bx, input status is 0x03BA (monochrome adapter)
		  1=CRT controller address is 0x03Dx, input status is 0x03DA (color graphics adapter)


    According to:
    https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/532192/intel-de1-soc-vga-controller-in-vhdl
    ..both hsync and vsync are negative polarity. In actual practice I found my LCD monitors
    worked fine whether h/vsync pulses were positive or negative.

    I found the 28.322MHz clock setting is what most text modes need, and that works for
    both 70Hz and 60Hz refresh. What matters is the number of scanlines and horiz total
    to affect the refresh rate.

SEQUENCER REGISTERS
===================

Sequencer Registers: "Reset Register" (Index 00h)
-------------------------------------------------
 _______________________________________________
|  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|
|                                   | SR  |  AR |
|___________________________________|_____|_____|

    SR -- Sychnronous Reset
    -----------------------
    When set to 0, this bit commands the sequencer to synchronously clear and halt.
    Bits 1 and 0 must be 1 to allow the sequencer to operate. To prevent the loss of data,
    bit 1 must be set to 0 during the active display interval before changing the clock selection.
    The clock is changed through the Clocking Mode register or the Miscellaneous Output register."

    AR -- Asynchronous Reset
    -----------------------
    When set to 0, this bit commands the sequencer to asynchronously clear and halt.
    Resetting the sequencer with this bit can cause loss of video data.


Sequencer Registers: "Clocking Mode Register" (Index 01h)
---------------------------------------------------------
 _________________________________________________
|  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |   0   |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_______|
|           |  SD |  S4 | DCR | SLR |     | 9/8DM |
|___________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_______|

    SD -- Screen Disable
    --------------------
    Set to 1, this turns off the display and assigns maximum memory bandwidth to the system.
    Although display is blanked, synchronization pulses are maintained.
    This can be used for rapid full-screen updates.

    S4 -- Shift Four Enable
    -----------------------
    When "Shift 4" and "Shift Load" are set to 0, the video serializers are loaded every character clock.
    When "Shift 4" is set to 1, the video serializers are loaded every forth character clock, useful when
    32 bits are fetched per cycle and chained together in the shift registers.

    DCR - Dot Clock Rate
    --------------------
    When set to 0, this bit selects normal dot clocks derived from the sequencer master clock input.
    When set to 1, master clock will be divided by 2 to generate the dot clock. All other timings
    are affected because they are derived from the dot clock. The dot clock divided by 2 is used for
    320 and 360 horizontal PEL modes.

    SLR - Shift/Load Rate
    ---------------------
    When this bit and bit 4 are set to 0, the video serializers are loaded every character clock.
    When this bit is set to 1, the video serializers are loaded every other character clock,
    which is useful when 16 bits are fetched per cycle and chained together in the shift registers.
    The Type 2 video behaves as if this bit is set to 0; therefore, programs should set it to 0.

    9/8DM -- 9/8 Dot Mode
    ---------------------
    This field is used to select whether a character is 8 or 9 dots wide.
    This can be used to select between 720 and 640 pixel modes (or 360 and 320) and is also used
    to provide 9 bit wide character fonts in text mode. The possible values for this field are:
        0 - Selects 9 dots per character.
        1 - Selects 8 dots per character.
